 * @ngdoc module
 * @name ngAnimate
 * @description
 *
 * The `ngAnimate` module provides support for JavaScript, CSS3 transition and CSS3 keyframe animation hooks within existing core and custom directives.
 *
 * <div doc-module-components="ngAnimate"></div>
 *
 * # Usage
 *
 * To see animations in action, all that is required is to define the appropriate CSS classes
 * or to register a JavaScript animation via the `myModule.animation()` function. The directives that support animation automatically are:
 * `ngRepeat`, `ngInclude`, `ngIf`, `ngSwitch`, `ngShow`, `ngHide`, `ngView` and `ngClass`. Custom directives can take advantage of animation
 * by using the `$animate` service.
 *
 * Below is a more detailed breakdown of the supported animation events provided by pre-existing ng directives:
 *
 * | Directive                                                                                                | Supported Animations                                                     |
 * |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat#animations ngRepeat}                                                        | enter, leave and move                                                    |
 * | {@link ngRoute.directive:ngView#animations ngView}                                                       | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngInclude#animations ngInclude}                                                      | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngSwitch#animations ngSwitch}                                                        | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngIf#animations ngIf}                                                                | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngClass#animations ngClass}                                                          | add and remove (the CSS class(es) present)                               |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngShow#animations ngShow} & {@link ng.directive:ngHide#animations ngHide}            | add and remove (the ng-hide class value)                                 |
 * | {@link ng.directive:form#animation-hooks form} & {@link ng.directive:ngModel#animation-hooks ngModel}    | add and remove (dirty, pristine, valid, invalid & all other validations) |
 * | {@link module:ngMessages#animations ngMessages}                                                          | add and remove (ng-active & ng-inactive)                                 |
 * | {@link module:ngMessages#animations ngMessage}                                                           | enter and leave                                                          |
 *
 * You can find out more information about animations upon visiting each directive page.
 *
 * Below is an example of how to apply animations to a directive that supports animation hooks:
 *
 * ```html
 * <style type="text/css">
 * .slide.ng-enter, .slide.ng-leave {
 *   -webkit-transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 * }
 *
 * .slide.ng-enter { }        /&#42; starting animations for enter &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-enter.ng-enter-active { } /&#42; terminal animations for enter &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-leave { }        /&#42; starting animations for leave &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-leave.ng-leave-active { } /&#42; terminal animations for leave &#42;/
 * </style>
 *
 * <!--
 * the animate service will automatically add .ng-enter and .ng-leave to the element
 * to trigger the CSS transition/animations
 * -->
 * <ANY class="slide" ng-include="..."></ANY>
 * ```
 *
 * Keep in mind that, by default, if an animation is running, any child elements cannot be animated
 * until the parent element's animation has completed. This blocking feature can be overridden by
 * placing the `ng-animate-children` attribute on a parent container tag.
 *
 * ```html
 * <div class="slide-animation" ng-if="on" ng-animate-children>
 *   <div class="fade-animation" ng-if="on">
 *     <div class="explode-animation" ng-if="on">
 *        ...
 *     </div>
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * When the `on` expression value changes and an animation is triggered then each of the elements within
 * will all animate without the block being applied to child elements.
 *
 * ## Are animations run when the application starts?
 * No they are not. When an application is bootstrapped Angular will disable animations from running to avoid
 * a frenzy of animations from being triggered as soon as the browser has rendered the screen. For this to work,
 * Angular will wait for two digest cycles until enabling animations. From there on, any animation-triggering
 * layout changes in the application will trigger animations as normal.
 *
 * In addition, upon bootstrap, if the routing system or any directives or load remote data (via $http) then Angular
 * will automatically extend the wait time to enable animations once **all** of the outbound HTTP requests
 * are complete.
 *
 * ## CSS-defined Animations
 * The animate service will automatically apply two CSS classes to the animated element and these two CSS classes
 * are designed to contain the start and end CSS styling. Both CSS transitions and keyframe animations are supported
 * and can be used to play along with this naming structure.
 *
 * The following code below demonstrates how to perform animations using **CSS transitions** with Angular:
 *
 * ```html
 * <style type="text/css">
 * /&#42;
 *  The animate class is apart of the element and the ng-enter class
 *  is attached to the element once the enter animation event is triggered
 * &#42;/
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter {
 *  -webkit-transition: 1s linear all; /&#42; Safari/Chrome &#42;/
 *  transition: 1s linear all; /&#42; All other modern browsers and IE10+ &#42;/
 *
 *  /&#42; The animation preparation code &#42;/
 *  opacity: 0;
 * }
 *
 * /&#42;
 *  Keep in mind that you want to combine both CSS
 *  classes together to avoid any CSS-specificity
 *  conflicts
 * &#42;/
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *  /&#42; The animation code itself &#42;/
 *  opacity: 1;
 * }
 * </style>
 *
 * <div class="view-container">
 *   <div ng-view class="reveal-animation"></div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * The following code below demonstrates how to perform animations using **CSS animations** with Angular:
 *
 * ```html
 * <style type="text/css">
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter {
 *   -webkit-animation: enter_sequence 1s linear; /&#42; Safari/Chrome &#42;/
 *   animation: enter_sequence 1s linear; /&#42; IE10+ and Future Browsers &#42;/
 * }
 * @-webkit-keyframes enter_sequence {
 *   from { opacity:0; }
 *   to { opacity:1; }
 * }
 * @keyframes enter_sequence {
 *   from { opacity:0; }
 *   to { opacity:1; }
 * }
 * </style>
 *
 * <div class="view-container">
 *   <div ng-view class="reveal-animation"></div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * Both CSS3 animations and transitions can be used together and the animate service will figure out the correct duration and delay timing.
 *
 * Upon DOM mutation, the event class is added first (something like `ng-enter`), then the browser prepares itself to add
 * the active class (in this case `ng-enter-active`) which then triggers the animation. The animation module will automatically
 * detect the CSS code to determine when the animation ends. Once the animation is over then both CSS classes will be
 * removed from the DOM. If a browser does not support CSS transitions or CSS animations then the animation will start and end
 * immediately resulting in a DOM element that is at its final state. This final state is when the DOM element
 * has no CSS transition/animation classes applied to it.
 *
 * ### Structural transition animations
 *
 * Structural transitions (such as enter, leave and move) will always apply a `0s none` transition
 * value to force the browser into rendering the styles defined in the setup (`.ng-enter`, `.ng-leave`
 * or `.ng-move`) class. This means that any active transition animations operating on the element
 * will be cut off to make way for the enter, leave or move animation.
 *
 * ### Class-based transition animations
 *
 * Class-based transitions refer to transition animations that are triggered when a CSS class is
 * added to or removed from the element (via `$animate.addClass`, `$animate.removeClass`,
 * `$animate.setClass`, or by directives such as `ngClass`, `ngModel` and `form`).
 * They are different when compared to structural animations since they **do not cancel existing
 * animations** nor do they **block successive transitions** from rendering on the same element.
 * This distinction allows for **multiple class-based transitions** to be performed on the same element.
 *
 * In addition to ngAnimate supporting the default (natural) functionality of class-based transition
 * animations, ngAnimate also decorates the element with starting and ending CSS classes to aid the
 * developer in further styling the element throughout the transition animation. Earlier versions
 * of ngAnimate may have caused natural CSS transitions to break and not render properly due to
 * $animate temporarily blocking transitions using `0s none` in order to allow the setup CSS class
 * (the `-add` or `-remove` class) to be applied without triggering an animation. However, as of
 * **version 1.3**, this workaround has been removed with ngAnimate and all non-ngAnimate CSS
 * class transitions are compatible with ngAnimate.
 *
 * There is, however, one special case when dealing with class-based transitions in ngAnimate.
 * When rendering class-based transitions that make use of the setup and active CSS classes
 * (e.g. `.fade-add` and `.fade-add-active` for when `.fade` is added) be sure to define
 * the transition value **on the active CSS class** and not the setup class.
 *
 * ```css
 * .fade-add {
 *   /&#42; remember to place a 0s transition here
 *      to ensure that the styles are applied instantly
 *      even if the element already has a transition style &#42;/
 *   transition:0s linear all;
 *
 *   /&#42; starting CSS styles &#42;/
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * .fade-add.fade-add-active {
 *   /&#42; this will be the length of the animation &#42;/
 *   transition:1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The setup CSS class (in this case `.fade-add`) also has a transition style property, however, it
 * has a duration of zero. This may not be required, however, incase the browser is unable to render
 * the styling present in this CSS class instantly then it could be that the browser is attempting
 * to perform an unnecessary transition.
 *
 * This workaround, however, does not apply to  standard class-based transitions that are rendered
 * when a CSS class containing a transition is applied to an element:
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; this works as expected &#42;/
 * .fade {
 *   transition:1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Please keep this in mind when coding the CSS markup that will be used within class-based transitions.
 * Also, try not to mix the two class-based animation flavors together since the CSS code may become
 * overly complex.
 *
 *
 * ### Preventing Collisions With Third Party Libraries
 *
 * Some third-party frameworks place animation duration defaults across many element or className
 * selectors in order to make their code small and reuseable. This can lead to issues with ngAnimate, which
 * is expecting actual animations on these elements and has to wait for their completion.
 *
 * You can prevent this unwanted behavior by using a prefix on all your animation classes:
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; prefixed with animate- &#42;/
 * .animate-fade-add.animate-fade-add-active {
 *   transition:1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You then configure `$animate` to enforce this prefix:
 *
 * ```js
 * $animateProvider.classNameFilter(/animate-/);
 * ```
 * </div>
 *
 * ### CSS Staggering Animations
 * A Staggering animation is a collection of animations that are issued with a slight delay in between each successive operation resulting in a
 * curtain-like effect. The ngAnimate module (versions >=1.2) supports staggering animations and the stagger effect can be
 * performed by creating a **ng-EVENT-stagger** CSS class and attaching that class to the base CSS class used for
 * the animation. The style property expected within the stagger class can either be a **transition-delay** or an
 * **animation-delay** property (or both if your animation contains both transitions and keyframe animations).
 *
 * ```css
 * .my-animation.ng-enter {
 *   /&#42; standard transition code &#42;/
 *   -webkit-transition: 1s linear all;
 *   transition: 1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * .my-animation.ng-enter-stagger {
 *   /&#42; this will have a 100ms delay between each successive leave animation &#42;/
 *   -webkit-transition-delay: 0.1s;
 *   transition-delay: 0.1s;
 *
 *   /&#42; in case the stagger doesn't work then these two values
 *    must be set to 0 to avoid an accidental CSS inheritance &#42;/
 *   -webkit-transition-duration: 0s;
 *   transition-duration: 0s;
 * }
 * .my-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *   /&#42; standard transition styles &#42;/
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Staggering animations work by default in ngRepeat (so long as the CSS class is defined). Outside of ngRepeat, to use staggering animations
 * on your own, they can be triggered by firing multiple calls to the same event on $animate. However, the restrictions surrounding this
 * are that each of the elements must have the same CSS className value as well as the same parent element. A stagger operation
 * will also be reset if more than 10ms has passed after the last animation has been fired.
 *
 * The following code will issue the **ng-leave-stagger** event on the element provided:
 *
 * ```js
 * var kids = parent.children();
 *
 * $animate.leave(kids[0]); //stagger index=0
 * $animate.leave(kids[1]); //stagger index=1
 * $animate.leave(kids[2]); //stagger index=2
 * $animate.leave(kids[3]); //stagger index=3
 * $animate.leave(kids[4]); //stagger index=4
 *
 * $timeout(function() {
 *   //stagger has reset itself
 *   $animate.leave(kids[5]); //stagger index=0
 *   $animate.leave(kids[6]); //stagger index=1
 * }, 100, false);
 * ```
 *
 * Stagger animations are currently only supported within CSS-defined animations.
 *
 * ## JavaScript-defined Animations
 * In the event that you do not want to use CSS3 transitions or CSS3 animations or if you wish to offer animations on browsers that do not
 * yet support CSS transitions/animations, then you can make use of JavaScript animations defined inside of your AngularJS module.
 *
 * ```js
 * //!annotate="YourApp" Your AngularJS Module|Replace this or ngModule with the module that you used to define your application.
 * var ngModule = angular.module('YourApp', ['ngAnimate']);
 * ngModule.animation('.my-crazy-animation', function() {
 *   return {
 *     enter: function(element, done) {
 *       //run the animation here and call done when the animation is complete
 *       return function(cancelled) {
 *         //this (optional) function will be called when the animation
 *         //completes or when the animation is cancelled (the cancelled
 *         //flag will be set to true if cancelled).
 *       };
 *     },
 *     leave: function(element, done) { },
 *     move: function(element, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered before the class is added
 *     beforeAddClass: function(element, className, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered after the class is added
 *     addClass: function(element, className, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered before the class is removed
 *     beforeRemoveClass: function(element, className, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered after the class is removed
 *     removeClass: function(element, className, done) { }
 *   };
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * JavaScript-defined animations are created with a CSS-like class selector and a collection of events which are set to run
 * a javascript callback function. When an animation is triggered, $animate will look for a matching animation which fits
 * the element's CSS class attribute value and then run the matching animation event function (if found).
 * In other words, if the CSS classes present on the animated element match any of the JavaScript animations then the callback function will
 * be executed. It should be also noted that only simple, single class selectors are allowed (compound class selectors are not supported).
 *
 * Within a JavaScript animation, an object containing various event callback animation functions is expected to be returned.
 * As explained above, these callbacks are triggered based on the animation event. Therefore if an enter animation is run,
 * and the JavaScript animation is found, then the enter callback will handle that animation (in addition to the CSS keyframe animation
 * or transition code that is defined via a stylesheet).
 *
 *
 * ### Applying Directive-specific Styles to an Animation
 * In some cases a directive or service may want to provide `$animate` with extra details that the animation will
 * include into its animation. Let's say for example we wanted to render an animation that animates an element
 * towards the mouse coordinates as to where the user clicked last. By collecting the X/Y coordinates of the click
 * (via the event parameter) we can set the `top` and `left` styles into an object and pass that into our function
 * call to `$animate.addClass`.
 *
 * ```js
 * canvas.on('click', function(e) {
 *   $animate.addClass(element, 'on', {
 *     to: {
 *       left : e.client.x + 'px',
 *       top : e.client.y + 'px'
 *     }
 *   }):
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Now when the animation runs, and a transition or keyframe animation is picked up, then the animation itself will
 * also include and transition the styling of the `left` and `top` properties into its running animation. If we want
 * to provide some starting animation values then we can do so by placing the starting animations styles into an object
 * called `from` in the same object as the `to` animations.
 *
 * ```js
 * canvas.on('click', function(e) {
 *   $animate.addClass(element, 'on', {
 *     from: {
 *        position: 'absolute',
 *        left: '0px',
 *        top: '0px'
 *     },
 *     to: {
 *       left : e.client.x + 'px',
 *       top : e.client.y + 'px'
 *     }
 *   }):
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Once the animation is complete or cancelled then the union of both the before and after styles are applied to the
 * element. If `ngAnimate` is not present then the styles will be applied immediately.

      /**
       * @ngdoc service
       * @name $animate
       * @kind object
       *
       * @description
       * The `$animate` service provides animation detection support while performing DOM operations (enter, leave and move) as well as during addClass and removeClass operations.
       * When any of these operations are run, the $animate service
       * will examine any JavaScript-defined animations (which are defined by using the $animateProvider provider object)
       * as well as any CSS-defined animations against the CSS classes present on the element once the DOM operation is run.
       *
       * The `$animate` service is used behind the scenes with pre-existing directives and animation with these directives
       * will work out of the box without any extra configuration.
       *
       * Requires the {@link ngAnimate `ngAnimate`} module to be installed.
       *
       * Please visit the {@link ngAnimate `ngAnimate`} module overview page learn more about how to use animations in your application.
       * ## Callback Promises
       * With AngularJS 1.3, each of the animation methods, on the `$animate` service, return a promise when called. The
       * promise itself is then resolved once the animation has completed itself, has been cancelled or has been
       * skipped due to animations being disabled. (Note that even if the animation is cancelled it will still
       * call the resolve function of the animation.)
       *
       * ```js
       * $animate.enter(element, container).then(function() {
       *   //...this is called once the animation is complete...
       * });
       * ```
       *
       * Also note that, due to the nature of the callback promise, if any Angular-specific code (like changing the scope,
       * location of the page, etc...) is executed within the callback promise then be sure to wrap the code using
       * `$scope.$apply(...)`;
       *
       * ```js
       * $animate.leave(element).then(function() {
       *   $scope.$apply(function() {
       *     $location.path('/new-page');
       *   });
       * });
       * ```
       *
       * An animation can also be cancelled by calling the `$animate.cancel(promise)` method with the provided
       * promise that was returned when the animation was started.
       *
       * ```js
       * var promise = $animate.addClass(element, 'super-long-animation');
       * promise.then(function() {
       *   //this will still be called even if cancelled
       * });
       *
       * element.on('click', function() {
       *   //tooo lazy to wait for the animation to end
       *   $animate.cancel(promise);
       * });
       * ```
       *
       * (Keep in mind that the promise cancellation is unique to `$animate` since promises in
       * general cannot be cancelled.)
       *

         * | Animation Step                                                                                                        | What the element class attribute looks like                  |
         * |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
         * | 1. `$animate.animate(...)` is called                                                                                  | `class="my-animation"`                                       |
         * | 2. `$animate` waits for the next digest to start the animation                                                        | `class="my-animation ng-animate"`                            |
         * | 3. `$animate` runs the JavaScript-defined animations detected on the element                                          | `class="my-animation ng-animate"`                            |
         * | 4. the `className` class value is added to the element                                                                | `class="my-animation ng-animate className"`                  |
         * | 5. `$animate` scans the element styles to get the CSS transition/animation duration and delay                         | `class="my-animation ng-animate className"`                  |
         * | 6. `$animate` blocks all CSS transitions on the element to ensure the `.className` class styling is applied right away| `class="my-animation ng-animate className"`                  |
         * | 7. `$animate` applies the provided collection of `from` CSS styles to the element                                     | `class="my-animation ng-animate className"`                  |
         * | 8. `$animate` waits for a single animation frame (this performs a reflow)                                             | `class="my-animation ng-animate className"`                  |
         * | 9. `$animate` removes the CSS transition block placed on the element                                                  | `class="my-animation ng-animate className"`                  |
         * | 10. the `className-active` class is added (this triggers the CSS transition/animation)                                | `class="my-animation ng-animate className className-active"` |
         * | 11. `$animate` applies the collection of `to` CSS styles to the element which are then handled by the transition      | `class="my-animation ng-animate className className-active"` |
         * | 12. `$animate` waits for the animation to complete (via events and timeout)                                           | `class="my-animation ng-animate className className-active"` |
         * | 13. The animation ends and all generated CSS classes are removed from the element                                     | `class="my-animation"`                                       |
         * | 14. The returned promise is resolved.                                                                                 | `class="my-animation"`                                       |

         * @description
         * Triggers a custom animation event based off the className variable and then removes the CSS class provided by the className value
         * from the element. Unlike the other animation methods, the animate service will suffix the className value with {@type -remove} in
         * order to provide the animate service the setup and active CSS classes in order to trigger the animation (this will be skipped if
         * no CSS transitions or keyframes are defined on the -remove or base CSS classes).
         *
         * Below is a breakdown of each step that occurs during removeClass animation:
         *
         * | Animation Step                                                                                                       | What the element class attribute looks like                        |
         * |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
         * | 1. `$animate.removeClass(element, 'super')` is called                                                                | `class="my-animation super"`                                       |
         * | 2. `$animate` runs the JavaScript-defined animations detected on the element                                         | `class="my-animation super ng-animate"`                            |

         * | 5. the `.super-remove-active` classes are added and `.super` is removed (this triggers the CSS transition/animation) | `class="my-animation ng-animate super-remove super-remove-active"` |
         * | 6. `$animate` scans the element styles to get the CSS transition/animation duration and delay                        | `class="my-animation ng-animate super-remove super-remove-active"` |
         * | 7. `$animate` waits for the animation to complete (via events and timeout)                                           | `class="my-animation ng-animate super-remove super-remove-active"` |
         * | 8. The animation ends and all generated CSS classes are removed from the element                                     | `class="my-animation"`                                             |

   * @param {string} path Route path (matched against `$location.path`). If `$location.path`
   *    contains redundant trailing slash or is missing one, the route will still match and the
   *    `$location.path` will be updated to add or drop the trailing slash to exactly match the
   *    route definition.
   *
   *    * `path` can contain named groups starting with a colon: e.g. `:name`. All characters up
   *        to the next slash are matched and stored in `$routeParams` under the given `name`
   *        when the route matches.
   *    * `path` can contain named groups starting with a colon and ending with a star:
   *        e.g.`:name*`. All characters are eagerly stored in `$routeParams` under the given `name`
   *        when the route matches.
   *    * `path` can contain optional named groups with a question mark: e.g.`:name?`.
   *
   *    For example, routes like `/color/:color/largecode/:largecode*\/edit` will match
   *    `/color/brown/largecode/code/with/slashes/edit` and extract:
   *
   *    * `color: brown`
   *    * `largecode: code/with/slashes`.
   *
   *
   * @param {Object} route Mapping information to be assigned to `$route.current` on route
   *    match.
   *
   *    Object properties:
   *
   *    - `controller` – `{(string|function()=}` – Controller fn that should be associated with
   *      newly created scope or the name of a {@link angular.Module#controller registered
   *      controller} if passed as a string.
   *    - `controllerAs` – `{string=}` – A controller alias name. If present the controller will be
   *      published to scope under the `controllerAs` name.
   *    - `template` – `{string=|function()=}` – html template as a string or a function that
   *      returns an html template as a string which should be used by {@link
   *      ngRoute.directive:ngView ngView} or {@link ng.directive:ngInclude ngInclude} directives.
   *      This property takes precedence over `templateUrl`.
   *
   *      If `template` is a function, it will be called with the following parameters:
   *
   *      - `{Array.<Object>}` - route parameters extracted from the current
   *        `$location.path()` by applying the current route
   *
   *    - `templateUrl` – `{string=|function()=}` – path or function that returns a path to an html
   *      template that should be used by {@link ngRoute.directive:ngView ngView}.
   *
   *      If `templateUrl` is a function, it will be called with the following parameters:
   *
   *      - `{Array.<Object>}` - route parameters extracted from the current
   *        `$location.path()` by applying the current route
   *
   *    - `resolve` - `{Object.<string, function>=}` - An optional map of dependencies which should
   *      be injected into the controller. If any of these dependencies are promises, the router
   *      will wait for them all to be resolved or one to be rejected before the controller is
   *      instantiated.
   *      If all the promises are resolved successfully, the values of the resolved promises are
   *      injected and {@link ngRoute.$route#$routeChangeSuccess $routeChangeSuccess} event is
   *      fired. If any of the promises are rejected the
   *      {@link ngRoute.$route#$routeChangeError $routeChangeError} event is fired. The map object
   *      is:
   *
   *      - `key` – `{string}`: a name of a dependency to be injected into the controller.
   *      - `factory` - `{string|function}`: If `string` then it is an alias for a service.
   *        Otherwise if function, then it is {@link auto.$injector#invoke injected}
   *        and the return value is treated as the dependency. If the result is a promise, it is
   *        resolved before its value is injected into the controller. Be aware that
   *        `ngRoute.$routeParams` will still refer to the previous route within these resolve
   *        functions.  Use `$route.current.params` to access the new route parameters, instead.
   *
   *    - `redirectTo` – {(string|function())=} – value to update
   *      {@link ng.$location $location} path with and trigger route redirection.
   *
   *      If `redirectTo` is a function, it will be called with the following parameters:
   *
   *      - `{Object.<string>}` - route parameters extracted from the current
   *        `$location.path()` by applying the current route templateUrl.
   *      - `{string}` - current `$location.path()`
   *      - `{Object}` - current `$location.search()`
   *
   *      The custom `redirectTo` function is expected to return a string which will be used
   *      to update `$location.path()` and `$location.search()`.
   *
   *    - `[reloadOnSearch=true]` - {boolean=} - reload route when only `$location.search()`
   *      or `$location.hash()` changes.
   *
   *      If the option is set to `false` and url in the browser changes, then
   *      `$routeUpdate` event is broadcasted on the root scope.
   *
   *    - `[caseInsensitiveMatch=false]` - {boolean=} - match routes without being case sensitive
   *
   *      If the option is set to `true`, then the particular route can be matched without being
   *      case sensitive

     * `$route` is used for deep-linking URLs to controllers and views (HTML partials).

     * The `$route` service is typically used in conjunction with the

     * {@link ngRoute.$routeParams `$routeParams`} service.
     *
     * @example
     * This example shows how changing the URL hash causes the `$route` to match a route against the
     * URL, and the `ngView` pulls in the partial.

 * The `$routeParams` service allows you to retrieve the current set of route parameters.
 *
 * Requires the {@link ngRoute `ngRoute`} module to be installed.
 *
 * The route parameters are a combination of {@link ng.$location `$location`}'s
 * {@link ng.$location#search `search()`} and {@link ng.$location#path `path()`}.
 * The `path` parameters are extracted when the {@link ngRoute.$route `$route`} path is matched.
 *
 * In case of parameter name collision, `path` params take precedence over `search` params.
 *
 * The service guarantees that the identity of the `$routeParams` object will remain unchanged
 * (but its properties will likely change) even when a route change occurs.
 *
 * Note that the `$routeParams` are only updated *after* a route change completes successfully.
 * This means that you cannot rely on `$routeParams` being correct in route resolve functions.
 * Instead you can use `$route.current.params` to access the new route's parameters.
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 *  // Given:
 *  // URL: http://server.com/index.html#/Chapter/1/Section/2?search=moby
 *  // Route: /Chapter/:chapterId/Section/:sectionId

 *
 * @param {string=} autoscroll Whether `ngView` should call {@link ng.$anchorScroll

/**
 * @ngdoc service

 *
 * @description
 *   The input is sanitized by parsing the HTML into tokens. All safe tokens (from a whitelist) are
 *   then serialized back to properly escaped html string. This means that no unsafe input can make
 *   it into the returned string, however, since our parser is more strict than a typical browser
 *   parser, it's possible that some obscure input, which would be recognized as valid HTML by a
 *   browser, won't make it through the sanitizer. The input may also contain SVG markup.
 *   The whitelist is configured using the functions `aHrefSanitizationWhitelist` and
 *   `imgSrcSanitizationWhitelist` of {@link ng.$compileProvider `$compileProvider`}.
 *
 * @param {string} html HTML input.
 * @returns {string} Sanitized HTML.

 */

/**
 * @ngdoc service
 * @name $resource
 * @requires $http
 *
 * @description
 * A factory which creates a resource object that lets you interact with
 * [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) server-side data sources.
 *
 * The returned resource object has action methods which provide high-level behaviors without
 * the need to interact with the low level {@link ng.$http $http} service.
 *
 * Requires the {@link ngResource `ngResource`} module to be installed.
 *
 * By default, trailing slashes will be stripped from the calculated URLs,
 * which can pose problems with server backends that do not expect that
 * behavior.  This can be disabled by configuring the `$resourceProvider` like
 * this:
 *
 * ```js
     app.config(['$resourceProvider', function($resourceProvider) {
       // Don't strip trailing slashes from calculated URLs
       $resourceProvider.defaults.stripTrailingSlashes = false;
     }]);
 * ```
 *
 * @param {string} url A parametrized URL template with parameters prefixed by `:` as in
 *   `/user/:username`. If you are using a URL with a port number (e.g.
 *   `http://example.com:8080/api`), it will be respected.
 *
 *   If you are using a url with a suffix, just add the suffix, like this:
 *   `$resource('http://example.com/resource.json')` or `$resource('http://example.com/:id.json')`
 *   or even `$resource('http://example.com/resource/:resource_id.:format')`
 *   If the parameter before the suffix is empty, :resource_id in this case, then the `/.` will be
 *   collapsed down to a single `.`.  If you need this sequence to appear and not collapse then you
 *   can escape it with `/\.`.
 *
 * @param {Object=} paramDefaults Default values for `url` parameters. These can be overridden in
 *   `actions` methods. If any of the parameter value is a function, it will be executed every time
 *   when a param value needs to be obtained for a request (unless the param was overridden).
 *
 *   Each key value in the parameter object is first bound to url template if present and then any
 *   excess keys are appended to the url search query after the `?`.
 *
 *   Given a template `/path/:verb` and parameter `{verb:'greet', salutation:'Hello'}` results in
 *   URL `/path/greet?salutation=Hello`.
 *
 *   If the parameter value is prefixed with `@` then the value for that parameter will be extracted
 *   from the corresponding property on the `data` object (provided when calling an action method).  For
 *   example, if the `defaultParam` object is `{someParam: '@someProp'}` then the value of `someParam`
 *   will be `data.someProp`.
 *
 * @param {Object.<Object>=} actions Hash with declaration of custom actions that should extend
 *   the default set of resource actions. The declaration should be created in the format of {@link
 *   ng.$http#usage $http.config}:
 *
 *       {action1: {method:?, params:?, isArray:?, headers:?, ...},
 *        action2: {method:?, params:?, isArray:?, headers:?, ...},
 *        ...}
 *
 *   Where:
 *
 *   - **`action`** – {string} – The name of action. This name becomes the name of the method on
 *     your resource object.
 *   - **`method`** – {string} – Case insensitive HTTP method (e.g. `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`,
 *     `DELETE`, `JSONP`, etc).
 *   - **`params`** – {Object=} – Optional set of pre-bound parameters for this action. If any of
 *     the parameter value is a function, it will be executed every time when a param value needs to
 *     be obtained for a request (unless the param was overridden).
 *   - **`url`** – {string} – action specific `url` override. The url templating is supported just
 *     like for the resource-level urls.
 *   - **`isArray`** – {boolean=} – If true then the returned object for this action is an array,
 *     see `returns` section.
 *   - **`transformRequest`** –
 *     `{function(data, headersGetter)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter)>}` –
 *     transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http
 *     request body and headers and returns its transformed (typically serialized) version.
 *     By default, transformRequest will contain one function that checks if the request data is
 *     an object and serializes to using `angular.toJson`. To prevent this behavior, set
 *     `transformRequest` to an empty array: `transformRequest: []`
 *   - **`transformResponse`** –
 *     `{function(data, headersGetter)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter)>}` –
 *     transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http
 *     response body and headers and returns its transformed (typically deserialized) version.
 *     By default, transformResponse will contain one function that checks if the response looks like
 *     a JSON string and deserializes it using `angular.fromJson`. To prevent this behavior, set
 *     `transformResponse` to an empty array: `transformResponse: []`
 *   - **`cache`** – `{boolean|Cache}` – If true, a default $http cache will be used to cache the
 *     GET request, otherwise if a cache instance built with
 *     {@link ng.$cacheFactory $cacheFactory}, this cache will be used for
 *     caching.
 *   - **`timeout`** – `{number|Promise}` – timeout in milliseconds, or {@link ng.$q promise} that
 *     should abort the request when resolved.
 *   - **`withCredentials`** - `{boolean}` - whether to set the `withCredentials` flag on the
 *     XHR object. See
 *     [requests with credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/http_access_control#section_5)
 *     for more information.
 *   - **`responseType`** - `{string}` - see
 *     [requestType](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest#responseType).
 *   - **`interceptor`** - `{Object=}` - The interceptor object has two optional methods -
 *     `response` and `responseError`. Both `response` and `responseError` interceptors get called
 *     with `http response` object. See {@link ng.$http $http interceptors}.
 *
 * @param {Object} options Hash with custom settings that should extend the
 *   default `$resourceProvider` behavior.  The only supported option is
 *
 *   Where:
 *
 *   - **`stripTrailingSlashes`** – {boolean} – If true then the trailing
 *   slashes from any calculated URL will be stripped. (Defaults to true.)
 *
 * @returns {Object} A resource "class" object with methods for the default set of resource actions
 *   optionally extended with custom `actions`. The default set contains these actions:
 *   ```js
 *   { 'get':    {method:'GET'},
 *     'save':   {method:'POST'},
 *     'query':  {method:'GET', isArray:true},
 *     'remove': {method:'DELETE'},
 *     'delete': {method:'DELETE'} };
 *   ```
 *
 *   Calling these methods invoke an {@link ng.$http} with the specified http method,
 *   destination and parameters. When the data is returned from the server then the object is an
 *   instance of the resource class. The actions `save`, `remove` and `delete` are available on it
 *   as  methods with the `$` prefix. This allows you to easily perform CRUD operations (create,
 *   read, update, delete) on server-side data like this:
 *   ```js
 *   var User = $resource('/user/:userId', {userId:'@id'});
 *   var user = User.get({userId:123}, function() {
 *     user.abc = true;
 *     user.$save();
 *   });
 *   ```
 *
 *   It is important to realize that invoking a $resource object method immediately returns an
 *   empty reference (object or array depending on `isArray`). Once the data is returned from the
 *   server the existing reference is populated with the actual data. This is a useful trick since
 *   usually the resource is assigned to a model which is then rendered by the view. Having an empty
 *   object results in no rendering, once the data arrives from the server then the object is
 *   populated with the data and the view automatically re-renders itself showing the new data. This
 *   means that in most cases one never has to write a callback function for the action methods.
 *
 *   The action methods on the class object or instance object can be invoked with the following
 *   parameters:
 *
 *   - HTTP GET "class" actions: `Resource.action([parameters], [success], [error])`
 *   - non-GET "class" actions: `Resource.action([parameters], postData, [success], [error])`
 *   - non-GET instance actions:  `instance.$action([parameters], [success], [error])`
 *
 *
 *   Success callback is called with (value, responseHeaders) arguments. Error callback is called
 *   with (httpResponse) argument.
 *
 *   Class actions return empty instance (with additional properties below).
 *   Instance actions return promise of the action.
 *
 *   The Resource instances and collection have these additional properties:
 *
 *   - `$promise`: the {@link ng.$q promise} of the original server interaction that created this
 *     instance or collection.
 *
 *     On success, the promise is resolved with the same resource instance or collection object,
 *     updated with data from server. This makes it easy to use in
 *     {@link ngRoute.$routeProvider resolve section of $routeProvider.when()} to defer view
 *     rendering until the resource(s) are loaded.
 *
 *     On failure, the promise is resolved with the {@link ng.$http http response} object, without
 *     the `resource` property.
 *
 *     If an interceptor object was provided, the promise will instead be resolved with the value
 *     returned by the interceptor.
 *
 *   - `$resolved`: `true` after first server interaction is completed (either with success or
 *      rejection), `false` before that. Knowing if the Resource has been resolved is useful in
 *      data-binding.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * # Credit card resource
 *
 * ```js
     // Define CreditCard class
     var CreditCard = $resource('/user/:userId/card/:cardId',
      {userId:123, cardId:'@id'}, {
       charge: {method:'POST', params:{charge:true}}
      });

     // We can retrieve a collection from the server
     var cards = CreditCard.query(function() {
       // GET: /user/123/card
       // server returns: [ {id:456, number:'1234', name:'Smith'} ];

       var card = cards[0];
       // each item is an instance of CreditCard
       expect(card instanceof CreditCard).toEqual(true);
       card.name = "J. Smith";
       // non GET methods are mapped onto the instances
       card.$save();
       // POST: /user/123/card/456 {id:456, number:'1234', name:'J. Smith'}
       // server returns: {id:456, number:'1234', name: 'J. Smith'};

       // our custom method is mapped as well.
       card.$charge({amount:9.99});
       // POST: /user/123/card/456?amount=9.99&charge=true {id:456, number:'1234', name:'J. Smith'}
     });

     // we can create an instance as well
     var newCard = new CreditCard({number:'0123'});
     newCard.name = "Mike Smith";
     newCard.$save();
     // POST: /user/123/card {number:'0123', name:'Mike Smith'}
     // server returns: {id:789, number:'0123', name: 'Mike Smith'};
     expect(newCard.id).toEqual(789);
 * ```
 *
 * The object returned from this function execution is a resource "class" which has "static" method
 * for each action in the definition.
 *
 * Calling these methods invoke `$http` on the `url` template with the given `method`, `params` and
 * `headers`.
 * When the data is returned from the server then the object is an instance of the resource type and
 * all of the non-GET methods are available with `$` prefix. This allows you to easily support CRUD
 * operations (create, read, update, delete) on server-side data.

   ```js
     var User = $resource('/user/:userId', {userId:'@id'});
     User.get({userId:123}, function(user) {
       user.abc = true;
       user.$save();
     });
   ```
 *
 * It's worth noting that the success callback for `get`, `query` and other methods gets passed
 * in the response that came from the server as well as $http header getter function, so one
 * could rewrite the above example and get access to http headers as:
 *
   ```js
     var User = $resource('/user/:userId', {userId:'@id'});
     User.get({userId:123}, function(u, getResponseHeaders){
       u.abc = true;
       u.$save(function(u, putResponseHeaders) {
         //u => saved user object
         //putResponseHeaders => $http header getter
       });
     });
   ```
 *
 * You can also access the raw `$http` promise via the `$promise` property on the object returned
 *
   ```
     var User = $resource('/user/:userId', {userId:'@id'});
     User.get({userId:123})
         .$promise.then(function(user) {
           $scope.user = user;
         });
   ```

 * # Creating a custom 'PUT' request
 * In this example we create a custom method on our resource to make a PUT request
 * ```js
 *    var app = angular.module('app', ['ngResource', 'ngRoute']);
 *
 *    // Some APIs expect a PUT request in the format URL/object/ID
 *    // Here we are creating an 'update' method
 *    app.factory('Notes', ['$resource', function($resource) {
 *    return $resource('/notes/:id', null,
 *        {
 *            'update': { method:'PUT' }
 *        });
 *    }]);
 *
 *    // In our controller we get the ID from the URL using ngRoute and $routeParams
 *    // We pass in $routeParams and our Notes factory along with $scope
 *    app.controller('NotesCtrl', ['$scope', '$routeParams', 'Notes',
                                      function($scope, $routeParams, Notes) {
 *    // First get a note object from the factory
 *    var note = Notes.get({ id:$routeParams.id });
 *    $id = note.id;
 *
 *    // Now call update passing in the ID first then the object you are updating
 *    Notes.update({ id:$id }, note);
 *
 *    // This will PUT /notes/ID with the note object in the request payload
 *    }]);
 * ```

/*
   Decode literal, length, and distance codes and write out the resulting
   literal and match bytes until either not enough input or output is
   available, an end-of-block is encountered, or a data error is encountered.
   When large enough input and output buffers are supplied to inflate(), for
   example, a 16K input buffer and a 64K output buffer, more than 95% of the
   inflate execution time is spent in this routine.

   Entry assumptions:

        state.mode === LEN
        strm.avail_in >= 6
        strm.avail_out >= 258
        start >= strm.avail_out
        state.bits < 8

   On return, state.mode is one of:

        LEN -- ran out of enough output space or enough available input
        TYPE -- reached end of block code, inflate() to interpret next block
        BAD -- error in block data

   Notes:

    - The maximum input bits used by a length/distance pair is 15 bits for the
      length code, 5 bits for the length extra, 15 bits for the distance code,
      and 13 bits for the distance extra.  This totals 48 bits, or six bytes.
      Therefore if strm.avail_in >= 6, then there is enough input to avoid
      checking for available input while decoding.

    - The maximum bytes that a single length/distance pair can output is 258
      bytes, which is the maximum length that can be coded.  inflate_fast()
      requires strm.avail_out >= 258 for each loop to avoid checking for
      output space.

 It is also called to create a window for dictionary data when a dictionary

 Providing output buffers larger than 32K to inflate() should provide a speed
 advantage, since only the last 32K of output is copied to the sliding window

 The advantage may be dependent on the size of the processor's data caches.

   Process a set of code lengths to create a canonical Huffman code.  The
   code lengths are lens[0..codes-1].  Each length corresponds to the
   symbols 0..codes-1.  The Huffman code is generated by first sorting the
   symbols by length from short to long, and retaining the symbol order
   for codes with equal lengths.  Then the code starts with all zero bits
   for the first code of the shortest length, and the codes are integer
   increments for the same length, and zeros are appended as the length
   increases.  For the deflate format, these bits are stored backwards
   from their more natural integer increment ordering, and so when the
   decoding tables are built in the large loop below, the integer codes
   are incremented backwards.

   This routine assumes, but does not check, that all of the entries in
   lens[] are in the range 0..MAXBITS.  The caller must assure this.
   1..MAXBITS is interpreted as that code length.  zero means that that
   symbol does not occur in this code.

   The codes are sorted by computing a count of codes for each length,
   creating from that a table of starting indices for each length in the
   sorted table, and then entering the symbols in order in the sorted
   table.  The sorted table is work[], with that space being provided by
   the caller.

   The length counts are used for other purposes as well, i.e. finding
   the minimum and maximum length codes, determining if there are any
   codes at all, checking for a valid set of lengths, and looking ahead
   at length counts to determine sub-table sizes when building the
   decoding tables.

   Create and fill in decoding tables.  In this loop, the table being
   filled is at next and has curr index bits.  The code being used is huff
   with length len.  That code is converted to an index by dropping drop
   bits off of the bottom.  For codes where len is less than drop + curr,
   those top drop + curr - len bits are incremented through all values to
   fill the table with replicated entries.

   root is the number of index bits for the root table.  When len exceeds
   root, sub-tables are created pointed to by the root entry with an index
   of the low root bits of huff.  This is saved in low to check for when a
   new sub-table should be started.  drop is zero when the root table is
   being filled, and drop is root when sub-tables are being filled.

   When a new sub-table is needed, it is necessary to look ahead in the
   code lengths to determine what size sub-table is needed.  The length
   counts are used for this, and so count[] is decremented as codes are
   entered in the tables.

   used keeps track of how many table entries have been allocated from the
   provided *table space.  It is checked for LENS and DIST tables against
   the constants ENOUGH_LENS and ENOUGH_DISTS to guard against changes in
   the initial root table size constants.  See the comments in inftrees.h
   for more information.

   sym increments through all symbols, and the loop terminates when
   all codes of length max, i.e. all codes, have been processed.  This
   routine permits incomplete codes, so another loop after this one fills
   in the rest of the decoding tables with invalid code markers.
